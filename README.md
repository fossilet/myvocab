# Development

Test to be done after every change:

* The dictionary:
Open http://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/vocabulary, the links should appear.

* The Challenge:
Answer the question, click the word in the round table, the links should appear
in the newly popped word definition. May need to test different kinds of
questions to ensure that the questions area are not messed up.
